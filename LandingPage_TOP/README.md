# LandingPage_OTP

CSS Foundations Final Project

For this project I’ll be creating an entire web page, only using HTML and CSS, from a design provided by The Odin Project course.

The design provided comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website (Design.png), and the other one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used (Fonts&Colors.png).

In the Design_Analysis.png image you would be able to find how I approach a new web page. I always try to get a clear idea of the HTML before coding and, as a rule, I think is always better to start a project on "paper" before coding.
